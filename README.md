ATTENTION!! This software is not finished and could not be working properly or work at all! Test it at your own risk!

In this repository I'm programming a HMI for the control of the mouse pointer
with the face of the user. 

In order to use it you'll need:

- OpenCV
- X11
- a webcam
- and patience!
- and maybe ROS!
